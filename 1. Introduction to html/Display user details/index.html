    <p>I am Kunal Tyagi and I'm an Algorithm Developer. My coding adventure kicked off in 2022 when the magic of mathematics, puzzles, and calculations led me to the incredible world of coding. I took the first step by diving into JavaScript through YouTube, whipping up mini projects with HTML and CSS.
        My knack for problem-solving, a dash of creativity, and my prowess in Data Structures and Algorithms are the secret ingredients I bring to the coding table. Ready to collaborate, innovate, and create web wonders!</p>
